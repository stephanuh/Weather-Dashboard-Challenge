## Credits

I was hard stuck on how can I receive an **API_KEY**. I followed the instructions [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys) and was able to grab one.

[Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [Render](https://render.com/) were also included in this application.
